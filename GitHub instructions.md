# List branches
git branch -a
# Checkout existing branch
git checkout <branch_name>
# Create new branch and publish to in GitHub 
git checkout -b <new_branch>\
git push -u origin <new_branch>
# After working on the code
git commit -m 'Type message here'
# For an already existing branch in GitHub
git push origin <branch_name>
# Delete a branch on GitHub 
git push origin :BranchName
# Delete a branch locally (Force delete use -D)
git branch -d <branch_name>

# Steps to follow:
NEVER work on the main branch\
Tell GROUP every time a pull request has been merged with main. Donâ€™t let your group members fall behind.\
Pull often, just to be sure. Even if no one has told you about changes on main, pull anyways.\
There is a visual of how far behind your branch is from main on GitHub under Branches.\
Double check with Group members before merging.\
Make sure you are on a branch before you start coding. Get in the habit of checking.

# get the latest pull version from main (Befor October 2020 it was referred to as master)
git pull origin main
# Checkout current branch or create a branch
git checkout <branch_name>
# after making changes to the file, commit locally frequently
git commit -m 'Type message here'
# push to GitHub once you feel its ready to merge with main.
git push origin <branch_name>
# review on GitHub and you can delete branch name after successful merge
